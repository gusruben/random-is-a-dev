# random-is-a-dev

[`is-a.dev`](https://is-a.dev) is a service that allows developers to get a cool ".is-a.dev" domain for their personal websites. Inspired by sites like StumbleUpon and The Useless Web, this project is the first thing that came to mind when I heard of it: `random-is-a-dev` is a small service that finds a random is-a.dev site. Most of these sites are developers' personal sites, so they're great for inspiration or just for fun exploration.

> *Many of these sites are also broken or have expired HTTPS certificates, so you might need to try a few times to find a working site!*
